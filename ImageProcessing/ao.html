<h2>Aliasing and oversampling</h2>
<h4>What</h4>
<em>Simplest sampling of one signal <code>b</code> at rate <code>a</code> is equivalent to</em>:<br>
<img src='cos(a)cos(b).png'><br>
.. in other words, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterodyne">sum and difference frequencies are generated</a>,<br>
called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing"><i>aliasing</i></a>
 when any (usually difference terms) are in a frequency range of interest.<br>
Minimizing aliasing artifacts wants a sampling rate over twice any frequency of interest,<br>
then a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter">low pass filter</a> to attenunate aliasing.<br>
To preserve details in content of varying frequencies and amplitudes,<br>
 sampling should actually be over 3x highest frequency of interest.<br>
This generates lots of samples, which may be (too)  expensive to process.<br>
When aliasing is insufficiently attenuated and the signal being sampled is imagery,<br>
then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern">Moir&eacute;</a> artifacts appear.&nbsp
Moving Moir&eacute is more obvious than is still:<br>

<i>blekenbleu's rule</i>:&nbsp antialiasing issues imply stingy oversampling.<br><br>

<ul>
<li>image display (and sensor) pixels sample images and are consequentially liable to aliasing
<li>many displays implement optical filtering to mitigate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen-door_effect">screen door effect</a>
<li>many image sensors incorporation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aliasing_filter#Optical_applications">optical anti-aliasing</a>
<li>these filters degrade sharpness.
<li>Headsets include optics;&nbsp <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_transfer_function">optics are not ideal</a>, losing contrast in finer details.
</ul><br>

For a 35ppd headset, images with spatial information above 16ppd are liable to aliasing.<br>
If antialiasing improves VR, then original render to binocular 2D was incorrectly filtered.<br>
Here are examples of filtering with nominally the same bandwidth (-3dB point),<br>
but some keep more information nearer that -3dB point<br> and better reject (mis)information beyond that point:<br>
<img src=3dB.gif><br><br>

In digital signal  processing, filters are implemented by IIR or FIR.<br>  IIR is more tolerated for audio;  FIR is much preferred for imaging,<br> since it borrows information from all nearby samples.<br>  More samples enable more coefficients for e.g. sharper cutoff, so less blur without aliasing.<br>  More samples can be obtained either by rendering from original 3D space at higher resolution,<br> which is relatively expensive but includes more information near the 3dB spatial frequency,<br> or by (cheaper) upscaling binocular video ("supersampling") after rendering.<br>  Oversampling is now common for digital audio and built into many DACs;<br>  it adds no information but helps reduce misinformation.<br><br>

I am no Nvidia VR processing expert;&nbsp filtering is reportedly relatively crude.<br>
  My rule of thumb for static imaging filtering wants at least 5x5 convolution.<br>
That means e.g. 7200x7200 to optimally render at 1440x1440 for 2880x2880 pixel displays.<br>
Some of that can be traded between spatial and temporal filtering for video.<br><br>

Because optics blur, optimal filtering wants sharpening AKA

Preemphasis pulses too wide provoke artifacts, e.g. visible oversharpening;<br>
higher frequency oversampling enables finer preemphasis control.<br>
