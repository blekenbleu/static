<h3>Mongoose 2016 Argus Sport fat bike</h3>
<img src=groinbike.jpg><br> <i>from <a href=https://www.mtbr.com/threads/argus-a-fat-bike-for-the-masses-review-assembly.1019867>mtbr</a></i><br><br>

<li><a href=https://vimeo.com/205294773>day ride</a>
<li><a href=https://vimeo.com/217839850>dark ride</a><br><br>

As received<ul>
<li>RD-M3000 rear Derailleur is low-end Shadow.&nbsp Mine shifts very poorly.
<li>My medium Argus Sport top tube is about 29.5 inches directly above bottom bracket<br>
 and 30.5 midway between head and seat tubes.&nbsp
I have a 32 inch stand over...<br>
Medium Argus felt small to me because short steerer tube, while the neck seemed too long.<br>
<img width=800 src=https://www.mtbr.com/attachments/6-jpg.1087430/><br><br>
Front shifter was redundant and omitted during riser bar installation;<br>
front derailleur, inner and outer chainrings were removed shortly after..
<li>Bottom bracket is <b>Feimin FP-B921/9SS</b>;&nbsp BSA threaded 1.37"x24 TPI, 103mm shell, 160mm square taper spindle<br>
<div align=center>

<a href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D13SZRGN>BUCKLOS BB100</a></div><br>

<li>removed large and small chainrings and replaced the rear derailleur with a used RD-M770 GS.
<li> had been unable to consistently shift into 8 or 2 from 9 and 7 or 1 and 3, respectively.
<li>Removed the rear wheel and tested the M3000 for rigidity before replacing; it failed.
<li>With RD-M770 installed, flex is noted only in the hanger (replacement on order).
<li><a href=https://www.mtbr.com/threads/argus-a-fat-bike-for-the-masses-review-assembly.1019867/page-4?post_id=12790201#post-12790201>pedal bearing adjustment</a>
<li>original front brake pad was comptible with shimano M775 M595 M596 M965 M665
<li>original Derailleur hanger replaced by Forest Byke 94
<li>2016 Argus has 180mm disc brake rotors
<li>spoke tensions, checked with Park TM-1:<br>
24-26 on rear driven side, 22-24 on rear brake side,<br>
25-27 on front brake side, 23-25 on front right;<br>
A few outliers were tweaked to those limits.

<br><br><li><table border=1><tr><td>Chain drop cured by installing OneUp 94/96 BCD 30T Narrow Wide.<br><br>
Bolt tabs required filing to fit Prowheel spider.</td><td>
 <img align=top src=ONEup30T.jpg></td></tr></table>

<br><br><li>brake pads tinkle...
<li>BB7 (perhaps clone) screwed to original front caliper bracket collided with slightly eccentric original rotor,<br>
 cured by inserting a pair of generic 6mm stainless flat washers between caliper and bracket.<br>
 7 inches of brake cable was removed at the same time (should have been done sooner).<br>
Braking feels much the same, but easier pad adjustment was the goal.<br>
Original inner pad had already worn significantly more than the outer.<br>
<img width=800 src=https://www.mtbr.com/attachments/bb7front-jpg.1092769/>

<br><br><li>After a sunrise session too bravely attacking ocean beach groins, spaced a couple hundred yards apart,<br>
 mild throbbing was noted on a paved street. &nbsp
Both rims and treads seemingly remained concentric,<br>
but Jug Pro 26x4.5 bead was sucked under for over 1/4 right front rim circumference.<br>
<br>Deflating and reinflating while tugging on sidewall a couple of times to recover.<br>
<img src=https://www.mtbr.com/attachments/eccentricjug-jpg.1092777/>
<br><br><li>personal preference upgrades:<br>
saddle and suspension post, riser bar, grips, controls, rear rack, mirror,<br>
 kickstand, bell, lights, narrow wide chainring, Pro 4.5 front tire, BB7s;<br>
spare RD hanger, missing links, stainless rotors and brake pads.<br>
Upgrading rear derailleur before 9 speed cassette wore out was unexpected...
<br><br><li>Stock calipers were magnetic, but evidently not enough;<br>
tinkling disappeared after replacing rear caliper.
<br><br><li>Chainstay width measures ~131mm @ widest sidewall,<br>
while forks measure ~ 136mm. Seatstays measure ~141mm.<br>
In other words, not ideal for Snowshoe 2XL tires
<br><br><li><a href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSK4FZPF>This rear rack</a> fits well, seems sturdy and is relatively inexpensive:<br>
<img src=https://www.mtbr.com/attachments/rearrack-jpg.1094336/><br>
Brazeon mounts space braces out further than necessary,<br>
but arguable help protect rear brake and derailleur.<br>
Splash board is presumably less effective than a dedicated rear fender.<br>
Spring-loaded clamp is less flexible than bungee cords.
<br><br><li>Q-factor is distance (parallel to bottom bracket spindle) between crank arm faces:<br>
<img src=https://forums.electricbikereview.com/attachments/bicycle-q-factor-jpg.21791/><br>

2016 Argus Sport Prowheel SUOLO Q-factor measures about 230mm,<br>
 depending on cranks' scrunch onto square taper bottom bracket spindle.<br>
230mm approaches the fat bike upper limit<br>
(With Turbine arms, Race Face 100mm bottom bracket also obtains 230mm).<br><br>

High Q-factors reportedly cause problems for some riders;<br>
I only discovered that was a consideration by reading,<br> but
might explain why sit bones with the same saddle<br>
and similar riding position feel different on other, non-fat, bikes.<br><br>

FSA specifies 209mm Q-factor for Comet fat crankset;<br>
FSA crankset for non-Sport Argus may be Mongoose-specific,<br>
but 209mm would suffice,<br>
since SUOLO crank arms clear Argus chainstays by 20mm.<br><br>

I never experience heel strike against a chainstay kickstand with SUOLO crankset,<br> but probably would with FSA Comet crankset.
<br><br><li>Argus Sport freehubs are steel and effectively immune to being grooved.<br>
My Sport has a QR axle; cassette lockring, typically wants around 350 in-lb torque.<br>
After glop removal, Sport's Suntour lockring displays 40 N.m or nearly 30 ft.lb<br>
(my 3/8 torque wrench maxed out @ 300 in.lb).
<br><br><li>Front axle had slightly shifted, despite (original) QR being as tight as manageable.<br>
<a href=https://youtu.be/GcxaJXRsEMM>Classic QR problem</a>; USA quarter is too large, but Canadian fits.<br>
Magic Marker the coin center, offer that up to the fork recess,<br>
 then feed the QR skewer from the other side and spin it against that Magic Mark,<br>
 then apply a regular center punch to that spin mark center.
<br><br><li>Replacing the 2016 Argus Sport front Kenda Juggernaut Sport 4.0 with a Pro 4.50<br>
 usefully improved handling on beach sand.<br>

Left: Pro 4.50; Right: Sport 4.0<br>
<img src=https://www.mtbr.com/attachments/pro45_sport40-jpg.1097201/>
<br><br><li>However, more rear traction was wanted for traversing slopes,<br>
 and there was still the occasional wipeout when e.g. changing direction on downslopes.<br>
 At best, most nominal 4.6-4.9 tires reportedly measure little more<br>
than Pro 4.50's 111mm width at useful pressures on 100mm rims.<br>
(FWIW, 2016 Argus Sport rim widths are approx 95.7mm inside and 101.5mm outside.)<br><br>

Vee evidently decided to rehabilitate Snowshoes' reputation<br>
 by offering 2XL sized to challenge many fat bike forks and frames.<br>

Left: Sport 4.0; Right: 2XL<br>
<img src=https://www.mtbr.com/attachments/sport2xl-jpg.1097209/>
<br><br><li>Left: Pro 4.50; Right: 2XL<br>
<img src=https://www.mtbr.com/attachments/pro2xl-jpg.1097213/>
<br><br><li>This Snowshoe 2XL weighs 1670 grams vs 1460 for the Pro 4.50.<br>
<img src=https://www.mtbr.com/attachments/grams2xl-jpg.1097214/>
<br><br><li>Given approx 10 lb weight for front wheel+tube+tire, another half pound is not noticed.<br>
Clearance between Sport forks and 2XL sidewalls is about 6mm:<br>
<img src=https://www.mtbr.com/attachments/clearance2xl-jpg.1097226/><br>
.. with about 3mm clearance between corner tread knobs and crown.
<br><br><li>Maintenance tip:&nbsp  tire talc should <i>NOT</i> be considered optional<br>
<img width=900 src=https://www.mtbr.com/attachments/tiretalc-jpg.1097222/><br>
... neither should it simply be sprinkled into the tire;&nbsp spread it around<br>
e.g. using paper towel, including tubes and inside sidewalls. Before talc,<br>
 reduce chances for sand grains to perforate tubes<br>
 by scrupulously cleaning tubes, inner wheels and tires (I use old terry dish cloths).<br><br>

After musical tires, the most immediately noticeable change was more plush ride over small bumps,<br>
 thanks to Pro 4.50 replacing rear Sport 4.0. Despite having seemingly plasticky and less supple sidewalls<br>
 than the Pro 4.50, Vee's 2XL rides similarly. The 2XL+Pro 4.50 combination has less rolling resistance<br>
 on soft wet sand than did Pro 4.50+Sport 4.0, with the 2XL @ 5psi, Pro @ 6psi and Sport @ 7psi.<br><br>

With chest and sinus congestion, conclusions about traction and handling are tentative<br> except that the Pro 4.50 improves rear grip in sand over the Sport 4.0.<br>
 In front, the 2XL flings more sand into the air (and my face) than did the Pro 4.50.<br>
 2XL tread may have been designed less for steering and lateral grip than longitudinal traction.
<br><br><li>replacing 4.0 with 4.50 rear tire effectively shifts ratios;<br>
11-tooth cog will be less used. However,<br> generally reduced rolling resistance means higher average speed<br> and no increased use of 36-tooth cog.<br><br>

I had anticipated replacing 30T chain ring with 28T, but no need.<br><br>

Despite non-magnetic (stainless) Presta valve stem, corrosion developed beneath rear rim retaining nut..<br>
Stainless and Aluminum are NOT friends when damp.<br>
Antenna installers put no-ox grease on fittings where aluminum touches stainless bolts.<br>

</ul>
<h3>Lauf Carbonara fork</h3>
Worldwide Cyclery offered 15% introductory discount from already competitive pricing.<br>
Gregg Kato's <a href=https://www.mtbr.com/threads/first-look-2015-mongoose-argus-alloy-framed-fat-bike.1169651/>'First Look: 2015 Mongoose Argus'</a> claims that it has a<br>
"0 stack headset that allows you to put in an aftermarket headset adapter<br>
so you can upgrade it to a tapered fork."<br><br>

.. but that is not quite accurate, at least for 2016 Argus Sport.<br><br>

Cane Creek EC44/40 lower bearing cup has an insertion depth of 12.mm,<br>
but the Argus Sport head tube lower insertion depth is only a little over 9mm.<br><br>

A belt sander removed nearly 3mm from EC44/40 cup insertion depth,<br>
then finished using a flat file and deburring tool.<br>
Argus fork and lower headset bearing located EC44/40 cup,<br>
then held square steel bar around cup lip to gradually tap in place using a small machine hammer.<br>
<img width=800 src=https://www.mtbr.com/attachments/ec4440-jpg.1115972/><br><br>

Cane Creek's 40-series 52/40 crown race is too tight for my Carbonara;<br>
I did not think to first measure Lauf's crown diameter..<br>
Should probably instead use Cane Creek alloy 110-Series instead of steel 40-series.<br>
Cane Creek also has a 10-series polymer crown race, but it lacks seal of 40 and 110 series.<br>
FWIW, these are not actually crown races, since Cane Creek uses cartridge bearings<br>
having their own races.<br><br>

Argus hub 300g<br>
- spoke hole center radius 29mm<br>
- flanges are 88.5mm apart<br><br>

Carbonara with axle and expander plug 1200g<br>
Argus wheel + DT Swiss hub 1680g<br>
<img src=https://www.mtbr.com/attachments/swissrim-jpg.1115974/><br><br>

DT Swiss 350 hub 216g<br>
- spoke hole center radius 29mm;&nbsp flanges are 96mm apart.<br><br>

Both hubs have 29mm spoke hole center radius, enabling spoke reuse.<br>
Any number of Internet wheel lacing How-To's discuss "key spoke",<br>
 but IMO there are 8 "key spokes";&nbsp
the hub flops around until all 8 are in place.<br>
<img src=https://www.mtbr.com/attachments/keyspokes-jpg.1115975/><br>
After those, I proceeded by installing successive adjacent spokes,<br>
paired for third crosses to minimize spoke bending.<br>
<img src=https://www.mtbr.com/attachments/cross3-jpg.1115976/><br>
The rim's valve stem hole was coated with gasket shellac to combat corrosion.<br><br>

----<br><br>

Lauf fork was installed without cutting, using a 40mm carbon fiber headset spacer.<br>
Unlike others, Wheels Manufacturing's spacer clears Lauf's steerer tube.<br>
Lauf's instructions specify new-to-me carbon assembly compound for the stem.<br><br>

200mm rotor and 20mm post spacer are needed for Avid BB7 caliper.</div><br><br>

<h3>rear bearing adjustment</h3>
Side play was discovered at rear axle while testing after 200mm rotor installation for Carbonara.<br>
 After reviewing <a href=http://forums.mtbr.com/fat-bikes/argus-fat-bike-masses-review-assembly-1019867-6.html#post12830924>vid1900's rear hub messages</a>, I dropped the rear wheel,<br>
 found my 15mm cone wrench and 17mm box wrench, pulled the brake side rubber seal and began fiddling.<br><br>

Tightening the lock nut while holding the cone nut reduces end play from slightly loose to binding.<br>
 The cone nut needed to be backed off about 1/2 turn from finger tight before tightening the lock nut.<br><br>

While this is my first fat bike, I have been maintaining road and mountain bikes for awhile,<br>
 and am concerned that this hub seems relatively weak. A 190mm axle may stretch more than do 135mm axles,<br>
 but this was after less than 500 miles. It had previously been adjusted when new then a week or so later.<br><br>

Planning ahead, the DT Swiss 350 Big Ride seems the lowest cost 190mm QR hub with strong reputation...<br>

FWIW, I was initially concerned that Argus' medium frame might be too small,<br>
 but standover clearance is much reduced after tire and fork upgrades.<br>

<h3>Cut Bars on short stem</h3>
Removing 30mm from each end of original (2016 Argus Sport) Mongoose bars,<br>
 replacing original stem with the shortest cheap stem on eBay<br>
 and clamping that on uncut Lauf steerer tube puts grips about where wanted.<br>
<img width=800 src=https://www.mtbr.com/attachments/cutbars-jpg.1119971/>

<h3>saddle tuning?</h3>
I may have replaced the stock Argus Sport saddle too hastily.<br><br>

Until now, my favorite saddles have been<br>
Fi'zi:k's discontinued Kurve Bull, which is unpadded and was expensive,<br>
and WTB's more affordable Speed Comp, which is too padded.<br>
<img width=800 src=https://www.mtbr.com/attachments/wtbspeed-jpg.1120278/><br>
(I might prefer, but have not tried, pricier Speed models.)<br><br>

Those two saddles have in common cutouts in their composite/polymer shells,<br>
so that covers behave like miniature hammocks for sit bones.<br>
<img width=800 src=https://www.mtbr.com/attachments/wtbcutouts-jpg.1120279/><br><br>

My Kurve Bull began creaking, so swapped on the Speed<br>
while the Fi'zi:k gets disassembled, cleaned, lubed and reassembled.<br>
When fetching the Speed, I noticed that the Mongoose saddle has<br>
1) screws to facilitate disassembly and reassembly<br>
2) star-shaped slices started in the shell beneath sit bones<br>
<img src=https://www.mtbr.com/attachments/mongoosesaddle-jpg.1120280/><br>
Perhaps those slices could be enlarged and/or cut out for improved sit bone conformity.<br><br>

Screws merely secure trim, which helps staples resist being pulled loose:<br>
<img src=https://www.mtbr.com/attachments/saddlescrews-jpg.1120333/><br>
Tuning surgery from the bottom will be less fun.<br>
Polymer shell is soft enough for X-acto blade to cut<br>
<img src=https://www.mtbr.com/attachments/x-acto-jpg.1120342/><br><br>

<h3>rear fender</h3>
Kenda Pro 4.5 throws more sand at bottom bracket and chainwheel than did Sport 4.0.<br>
BMI Karts & Parts sold 29" X 4.5" Red Motorcycle Fenders<br>
<img width=430 src=https://www.mtbr.com/attachments/fender-jpeg.1120890/> &nbsp <img width=550 src=https://www.mtbr.com/attachments/fendernut-jpg.1120891/>

<h3>back pedal</h3>
My lock nuts are actually 12mm.<br><br>

Returning balls to greased bearing races is easiest using a grease injector (pointless marinade syringe or horse syringe).<br>
 Cleaned balls stick to injector tip grease, then stick better to the greased races.<br><br>

I would not have expected those pedals to be rebuildable,<br>
and resin pedals are much kinder to shins than are alloy.<br><br>

FWIW, creaking thought to come from left pedal actually came from right square taper.<br>

<h3>derailleur hanger</h3>
Not wanting to wait, I bought mine from Amazon<br><br>

It was stiffer than the original, but also brittle, breaking while straightening a second time.<br>
Probably cast and neither forged nor heat-treated.<br>
<img src=https://www.mtbr.com/attachments/brokenhanger-jpg.1146468/><br>
Cheaper replacements can be found on eBay by searching for Timberline instead of 94 (but not so cheap as AliExpress).<br>

<h3>2016 Sport rims</h3>
Having changed 4 different tires over a half dozen times on either rim,<br> difficulty of maintaining concentric tire bead against rims is frustrating.<br>
 After fiddling with an original Jug 4.0 to get less than 2mm runout, then inflating to 9 psi and riding for a half hour,<br>
 runout was up to 5mm, which at 15 mph is enough to generate a bumpy ride on flat smooth pavement.<br><br>

<h2>Sun City</h2>
While working hide food into my
<a href=https://classicrendezvous.com/country-of-origin/the-british-isles/coventry-eagle/>1973 Coventry Eagle</a>'s Brooks saddle,
soon after moving to Sun City<br>
... it struck me that bicycling here would not be about covering distance or running errands,<br>
and much higher rolling resistance makes the fat bike better for exercise than a road bike.

<h3>SunRace STMS30 combined 10-speed shifter/brake lever</h3>
For beach riding with a 4.5" tire @ 3-5 psi and 30T chainring,<br>
the stock 9-speed Sunrace CS M99 Cassette has a good range;<br>
36T was so slow that I had a hard time balancing<br>
with torque to bury the tire in sand<br>
and 11T was too tall to overcome rolling resistance<br>
except down grades with the wind.<br><br>

Moving away from the beach and inflating to 10 psi expanded those tires,<br>
 which with bead runout left no clearance.&nbsp Reverting to original 4.0" Jug Sports<br>
 reduced effective gearing to often want 11T cog,<br> but step from 11T to 13T is excessive.<br><br>

Shimano's Acera ST-EF65 combined 9-speed shifter/brake works well with Ergon GP1 grips.<br>
While Shimano offers no comparable combined 10-speed control,<br>
both eBay and Walmart sold SunRace's STMS30 10-speed shifter/brake lever.<br>
It is no longer available...<br><br>

STMS30 cable pull shifting from 10 to 1 measured about 40mm,<br>
roughly matching 11T to 36T cog spacing on 10-speed cassettes,
wanting a derailleur with about 1:1 ratio.<br>
Shimano's 11-speed RD-M8000 may be ideal,
but an SRAM X7 9 speed Long Cage Rear Derailleur 1:1 (already on-hand) seems promising:<br>
<img src=https://www.mtbr.com/attachments/10speed-jpg.1217587/><br>
...with adequate range of motion and adjustment,
but confirmation pending delivery of a KMC X10EPT chain.<br><br>

An STSM30 downshifts up to 4 gears per stroke, but upshifts only one.<br>
An Acera ST-EF65 downshifts up to 3 gears per stroke, but also upshifts only one.

<h3>SunRace STMS30 shifter/brake lever review</h3>
10-speed chain arrived; as hoped, SRAM X7 9-speed 1:1 derailleur range of operation suits STMS30 and 10-speed Shimano cassette.<br>

Shifts are more positive, but many miles of beach sand had worn shift ramps on 9-speed cassette teeth and chain.<br>

Shifts feel less springy; 25% longer cable travel per shift reduces impacts of cable stretch and housing compression.<br>

<h3>bench stand</h3>
Replacing Nashbar portable stand freed up some floor space <br>and simplified access to bench drawers while sacrificing 5x5-inch benchtop space:<br>
<img src=https://www.mtbr.com/attachments/argusbench-jpg.1218294/><br><br>

Retracting crosstube reduces droop, but pedals cannot rotate:<br>
<img src=https://www.mtbr.com/attachments/benchstand-jpg.1218295/><br>
This stand seemingly has been replaced by Conquer 400-BENCH-RS, changing color to orange and clamp knob to quick release.<br>

<h3>maintenance - <i>24 Sep 2024</i></h3>
Argus fat bike resin platform pedal bearings have seized after < 2K miles;<br>
blame years pedalling along Edisto Beach shoreline.<br><br>

Most new platform pedals have metal pins;<br>
<img src=pedal_pin.jpg><br>
... but not being a shredded skin fan,<br>
I installed an unused pair of similar <a href=https://www.bikeman.com/PD3536.html>all-resin VP pedals</a><br><br>

<a href=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P49WLYK>Ergon GP1 Grips</a> were installed 8 years ago.<br>
<img src=GP1.jpg><br>
"Wings" discourage concentrating weight on palms with bent wrists<br>
... except that mine had over time  rotated enough to want repositioning.<br><br>

Nearly all pedalling this summer has been in faster gear ratios, with a 42T chain ring.<br>
SRAM PG-1050 cassette has 11,12,13,14,15,16,17,19,21,23 teeth;<br>
swapping in my 48T ring will run the chain nearer cassette center for less wear.</div> <br>
