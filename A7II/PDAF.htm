<h2>Autofocus</h2>

Contrast detect autofocus works by maximizing differences among adjacent pixels.<br>
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autofocus#Phase_detection>Phase detect autofocus</a> works similarly to split prism,<br>
comparing image slice pairs from different angles,<br>
and calculating how much refocus is wanted to bring slice features <i>in phase</i>.<br>
In theory, perfect phase detect autofocus can correct focus in one step.<br>
Practically, mirrorless in-sensor phase detection is less precise,<br>
wanting contrast detect autofocus for final correction.<br><br>

While mirrorless AF is imprecise, direction for correction is known, minimizing hunting.<br>
The camera must estimate how far the image-side focal plane<br>
is going to move for a given command to the lens. If it has that information<br>
Â -- and there are several possible ways of making that happen,<br>

<a href=https://blog.kasson.com/the-last-word/sony-a7ii-cdaf-anisotropy/>Mechanisms for focus peaking differ from CDAF</a><br><br>

Sony &alpha;7 PDAF sensors are in what would be the blue channel.<br><br>

Sony &alpha;7RIII tweaks focus by contrast detection (CDAF)<br>
after initial phase detection autofocusing (PDAF).<br>
Conventional wisdom has that CDAF tweak at the taking aperture<br>
so that focus shift in Sony lenses is not a problem.<br>
The &alpha;7RIII does not support manual AF Adjustments for native lenses.<br>
Conventional wisdom has that unnecessary, because CDAF tweaking.<br>
<a href=https://blog.kasson.com/a7riii/a7riii-af-accuracy-with-the-70-200-4-and-100-400-lenses/>
In fact, &alpha;7RIII corrects for focus shift <i>only in AF-S</i>, not AF-C.</a><br><br>

Shot-to-shot focus variation is worse in continuous than single focus mode.<br>
