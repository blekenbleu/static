<h3>GE GTWM4250D1WS Washing machine bearing replacements</h3>
Various HydroWave model employ different parts and procedures.<br>
<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu1bvoM4nI4>This video</a>, for a different model, misses a few points:<dl>
<dt><br>agitator removal
<dd>Yanking, as in several videos, seems unlikely for older<br>
(and presumably stiffer) plastic of agitators not previously removed.<br>

Force required using strap and lever tipped the washer.<br>
Crossing beneath lever stopped strap slipping from under agitator.
<dt><br>seal (<i>red arrow</i>) replacement
<dd>this was the most visibly deteriorated part in this washer.<br>
<img src=seal.jpg width=480>
<dt><br>sleeve bearing and washer lube
<dd>lithium grease seems obvious to combat wear
</dl>
Model differences:<dl>
<dt><br>air tube to control panel bracket
<dd><img width=480 src=airtube.jpg>
<dd>YouTube air tube connects to control panel
<dt><br>foam blocks under top cover rear corners
<dt><br>back panel interlocks with end caps
</dl>
Ten screws:&nbsp; avoiding reassembly confusion<ul>
<li>5 generic sheet metal screws
<li>2 black sheet metal screws for back panel
<br>(red arrow in air tube image, above)
<li>2 larger screws at top cover front
<li>ground screw near the motor
</ul>
Partially reinstalling non-generic screws at disassembly helps.
