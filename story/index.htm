At Lexmark, I wrote code for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%E2%80%93Penrose_inverse">Moore-Penrose inverse</a> more than once,
having misplaced a first version.<br>
Significantly smaller than others, my algorithm was not embedded in products,<br>
being instead used to generate tables that were embedded.<br>
Consequently, filing for a patent was unnecessary, but it now occurs to me<br>
that publishing it might have yielded some professional visibility.<br>
Even that second derivation took a week or two,
and recreating it now is probably beyond me.<br>
One night recently,
I woke up thinking about inflection points while working at IBM and Lexmark.<br>
Before forgetting more of them, here are related anecdotes.
