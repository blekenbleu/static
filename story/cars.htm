<h3>Cars</h3>
I learned about cars by helping Dad work on the family beaters.<br>
Before I left for college, the 2 family cars of interest (to me) were<br>
a 55 Olds, because it had snort, and 49 Mercury, which I thought looked great, about this color:<br>

Many 49 Merc coupes got chopped, which looked silly to me, but I preferred the 4 door anyway.

<p>When we married, Amy had a 57 Chevy which had been pounded to crap.<br>
We bought a 61 Merc, because cheap and a nice dark blue.<br>
Our Merc had the 292 V8 originally introduced in the Thunderbird;&nbsp we called it ThunderMerc.<br>

Leaking power steering was quickly replaced by manual.<br>
With open exhaust, 2-speed automatic, and throttle floored,<br>
ThunderMerc did not shift into high gear until nearly 80mph.<br>
It was nearly as fast in reverse as first gear, but pathologically unstable.<br>
When that transmission eventually blew, it was replaced by a 3 speed manual with floor shifter.<br>
This massively confused the speedometer, which indicated 59 while being clocked at 85.<br>
We drove it from Potsdam NY to Amy's folks near Batavia in well under 4 hours.<br>
Gas mileage increased to over 20mpg on Interstates.</p>

While at Clarkson, I ran a Texaco gas station as a foreign car garage.<br>
We bought a 1962 MGA 1600 MkII, advertised in Competition Press &amp Autoweek, which had been flipped at Bryer.<br>

I bought a 1964 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glas_GT#1300_GT">Glas 1300GT</a> cheap from a GI who had brought it back from Germany.<br>
Running across a Maserati similarly styled by Frua prompted writing this story.<br>

It was cheap because:<ul>
<li>clutch would not disengage
<li>engine would not shut off
</ul>
Not stopping was because a stuck high beam flasher relay effectively bypassed the ignition switch.<br>
Replacing that relay was easy, but I also rewired it to no longer bypass the ignition switch.<br>
The clutch problem was caused by broken springs in the friction plate.<br>
That was solved by welding the clutch solid at my weekly evening welding class.<br>

</p>
Our Econoline van with surprisingly little rust came with a very tired 144cid engine;<br>
we swapped in a healthy 200cid engine.&nbsp Main problems with this vehicle were in very cold weather;<br>
Brasher Falls temperatures often dropped below zero, then the steering would get very stiff<br>
and the transmission would be impossible to shift.&nbsp We learned to leave it in neutral when parked.<br>
The engine would start (with clutch depressed, of course), then release the clutch<br>
and let the engine stir transmission oil long enough to warm it, enabling shifting.<br>
