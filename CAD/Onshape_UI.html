 Onshape takes the security of your data seriously, and Onshape employees do not have access to your data.<br>

Account options are accessed by selecting the user name in the top right.<br>
 This menu navigates to account preferences, Action items for customers,<br>
 and allows you to view support tickets.</ul>

<dt>Below the Document toolbar is the Feature, Sketch, Assembly, or Drawing toolbar.
<dd>Each of these toolbars give access to the tools available in that tab.<br>
 They are context-sensitive and adjust automatically dependent on the active environment.<br>
 These toolbars can be customized to your preference, allowing you to choose which tools you want available.<br>
 Features can also be located using the Search tools option.<br>
 Hovering over a feature displays a tooltip of how to use it,<br> as well as a keyboard shortcut if there is one available.<br>
 Several tools have keyboard shortcuts;<br> a complete list of keyboard shortcuts is available in the help menu.<br>
 For quick access to tools most used,<br> the `S` key displays a shortcut toolbar that is context-sensitive and customizable.<br>


<dt>At the bottom, there is a tab for each Part Studio, Assembly, Drawing, or imported file contained in the Document.
<dd> Click on a tab to make it active.<br>
 To add more tabs select the plus sign in the bottom left and choose the tab type you would like to create.<br>
 The Tab manager is opened by selecting the bottom left icon.<br>
 This displays the tabs in another view, and allows you to search and filter for certain tabs.

<dt>To the left of each Part Studio or Assembly is a list.
<dd> <li>In the Part Studio the Feature list and Parts list are displayed,
 <li> in the Assembly the Instance list and Mate features list are displayed.<br>
 These lists provide the break-down of how that part or assembly was made<br>
 - which features were utilized, or which parts were inserted.<br>
 These lists are explained in more detail in future courses.</dl>


</p>
<p align=center style="page-break-after: always;"><dl>

<dt>In the middle is the graphics area, where you can interact with the model by selecting entities or rotating the view.
<dd> You can adjust the view with the mouse controls or by using the view cube and view options in top right.<br>
 Selecting a face of the view cube rotates the model to that orientation.<br>
 Use the view options to go back to a standard view like Isometric, or adjust the display style.

<dt>The Feature list, Instance list, and View cube
<dd> can be moved in the interface by dragging and dropping to a different location.
<dd> The lists can also be adjusted by dragging the outside edges to make it larger or smaller.

<dt>Mouse controls are a quick way to zoom, pan, and rotate the model in the graphics area.

 Press and hold the scroll wheel of the mouse to pan the graphics area.<br>
 To rotate the model, hold the right-mouse button, and move the mouse.<br>

 However, if these controls do not feel intuitive, you can customize them by navigating to your Account preferences and editing the View manipulation options.<br>


<dt>Left-clicking on a face, part, feature, or anything else selects that entity.
<dd> Onshape has persistent selection, meaning
<li> as you continue to select more entities, they are added to the selection group.<br>
 To deselect an entity click on it again.<br>
 To deselect all entities, click into the white space of the graphics area, or press Spacebar on the keyboard. </dd>

<dt>Parts, sketches, curves, surfaces, instances, and other entities can be hidden or shown in the graphics area<br>
 by clicking the eye icon next to that entity in the lists.
<dd> You might do this for a variety of reasons including,
<li> making it easier to select certain entities, or
<li> visualizing internal parts in an assembly.</dd>


<dt>Right-clicking in Onshape displays a context menu for that entity<br>
<li> giving you available options to choose based on the selection.
<dd> For example, right-clicking in white space displays a couple view options,<br>
 while right-clicking on a part displays several options for that part.</dd>


<dt>Creating a new feature or editing a feature is done with a dialog.
<dd> The dialog allows you to define the parameters specified to the feature.&nbsp This might require
<li> keying in a value,
<li> selecting an option from a menu,
<li> toggling a reverse direction icon,
<li> checking a checkbox,
<li> or clicking an entity from the graphics area.<br>
 Notice, the parameter highlighted in blue is active, and new selections are added there.<br>
 Notifications can appear in the top of the graphics area,<br>
  providing additional direction when using certain tools.<br><br>

 Clicking the green checkmark in a dialog accepts all edits and adds or updates that feature.<br>
 If you need to undo or redo an action, just select the arrows in the top left<br>
 or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Z or Ctrl+Y, respectively.<br><br>

 Clicking the red X discards any edits.<br></dd>


<dt><br>Errored features are displayed in red, meaning a feature did not generate properly.
<dd> Hovering over the feature displays a tooltip to help diagnose the issue.<br>
 It is recommended you fix any errored features.
