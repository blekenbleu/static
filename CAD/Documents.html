<h3>Onshape Document</h3>
<p align=center style="page-break-after: always;"><dl>

<dt> Documents are containers that keep CAD and non-CAD data for a design in one place.
<dd> Unlike a file-based system where parts, assemblies, and drawings exist as individual files,<br>
 an Onshape Document contains tabs for parts, assemblies, and drawings together. 

<dt>Documents are created or accessed from the Documents page.
<dd> First, sign into Onshape by  navigating to cad.onshape.com, and input your username and password.<br>
 After signing in, the Documents page opens.<br>
 This is where you manage all Documents you have access to.<br>
 It has filters to quickly access recently opened documents, documents you created,<br>
 or documents that have been shared with you.<br>
 In the middle, Last opened by me, Folders, and Documents are displayed from top to bottom.<br>
 To change the view of the Documents page toggle the grid view icon or list view icon in the top right corner.<br>
 When a document is selected, the Details of that Document display on the right side. 

<dt>To create a new document click Create and choose Document.
<dd> After naming the new document, it automatically opens.<br>
 This is a blank Onshape Document, whose interface was reviewed in the prior videos.<br>
 Onshape begins a new Document with two tabs: a Part Studio tab and an Assembly tab.<br>
 Notice, the Document name is at the top left, in the Document toolbar.<br>
  Note, clicking on the logo in the top left navigates back to the Document page.

<dt>The first icon next to the logo, is the Document menu.
<dd> In this menu, you can modify the Document properties and adjust settings specific to that Workspace. 

<dt>A new document automatically starts with units and other settings defined in your account preferences.
<dd> To change the units of the Workspace to be different than the account preferences,<br>
 select  Workspace units. Notice you can also modify the precision display of dimensions in this setting.<br>
 To accept the changes, click the checkmark icon.<br>
 This only changes the units for this document, and no other documents.

<dt>Each tab type contains different types of information.
<dd> To add more tabs, click the plus icon in the bottom left corner.<br>
 You can create new Part Studios, Assemblies, 2D drawings, folders,<br>
 and import files such as images, videos, or other CAD files.
